# Catch the Pink Flamingo:

## Case study on user engagement in relation to in-game interactions

1. Data Preprocessing: reading the csv files containing game data then performing data cleaning, renaming, merging, and aggregation operations to preprocess the data

2. Visualizations: using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to generate pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize the data

3. World Map Plot: using the folium library to plot user locations on a world map

4. Classification: performing data classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm and displaying their accuracy and confusion matrix.

5 Clustering: using the PySpark library to perform KMeans clustering on the data and visualize the Within Set Sum of Squared Errors (WSSSE) for different values of k

6. Graph Analysis: analyzing the most active teams based on their total clicks.
